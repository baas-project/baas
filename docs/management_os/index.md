# Overview Management OS
When a machine boots it gets offered a specialized Debian GNU/Linux
image over the network. This image contains the code which
communicates with the *Control Server* and actually flashes the code
onto the disk.

## Image Creation
Image creation is done by first generating a Docker image which is
extracted and converted into a
[initramfs](https://wiki.debian.org/initramfs) image. An initramfs
image is a mechanism used by the Linux kernel in order to access more
complicated programs, utilities and files which are not accessible to
just the kernel itself. Basically, it contains all the data needed to
boot the system itself. The upside of generating the image this is way
is that is easy to change packages which are installed onto the
management image. You can think of a new dependency, system utility or
interpreter.

During the image generation the code is compiled into binary and added
to the initialization processes, the IP address of the server is added
to the host file and the kernel is extracted out of the image. A
simple configuration file is added to the image as well, which is used
to set various developer debugging options.

The initramfs and the kernel are moved into the `/static` directory in
the *Control Server* so they can be offered to any machine requesting
a network boot.

```plantuml
@startuml
start

partition "Docker Image"  {
	:Compile the Go code to a binary;
	:Download required packages;
	:Enable vital system services;
    :Configure the binary to boot at startup;
	:Move the configuration file on disk;
}

:Extract the docker container;
:Add the server IP to the host file;
:Move the kernel to the control server;
:Remove the kernel and initramfs files from the extracted image;
:Compress into an initramfs file;
:Move to control server;
:Cleanup the build files;

## Boot Sequence
At the start of the image boot a custom binary is run which functions
as sequential program which runs from start to finish. Before running
any functions it will mount the machine image and fetch vital cache
information. First it will request the next boot configuration from
the server. It will receive a JSON message with information about
whether it should upload it's disk and where to, as well as
information about the image it should download.

First it will, if required and when the checksum is not the same,
create a datastream containing all the information from a device
file. It will then optionally compress it with either Gunzip or
Zstandard and send it over the network to the control server. When
either writing or reading the disks, it will first find the associated
partition in a cache stored on the machine disk.

!!! warning "On the data stream"

    Please be sure that you never accidentally copy the data to RAM at any point in the program. Doing so is a sure fire
    way to get the kernel to reap your process. Always make use of the `fs.CopyStream` function when dealing with data
    and double check what any library calls does not copy it implicitly either.

Downloading the data works basically in the exact same way, but in
reverse. So it will first create a stream from the server, decompress
it and write it to disk. Before doing this, we first unmount the
machine image so we can flash any updates.

As a final step it will set the
[BootNext](https://edk2-docs.gitbook.io/edk-ii-uefi-driver-writer-s-guide/3_foundation/readme.15/31511_boot_manager_bootnext_processing)
EUFI variable which is used to set the boot option for the next
boot. It should, after rebooting, revert back to the standard
configuration and restart this cycle. Finally, the image is rebooted
into the target image.
