#  Control Server
First of the two major components of the BAAS project is the Control
Server which forms the core of the program and allows users to access
the various features of the project. It coordinates access to the
machines, manages images and deals with logic of flashing those images
to the machines. Users can access the control server using a public
REST API or the official web frontend.

Currently the control server is implementation is concentrated in
three main parts: a iPXE server, REST API and a machine API. The
former is implemented in the `pixieserver` package and consists mostly
out of some boilerplate around the `pixiecore` library. The latter two
are implemented in the `api` subdirectory and they overlap as much as
possible.

## Documentation index
1. [Running the Server](running_baas_control_server.md)
2. [REST API](REST API.md)

## Overview of how the typical interaction works
When the control server is run the server will open a SQL database and
start a HTTP server. If a machine on the network boots, it will
receive a DHCP message over the network. First it will confirm if sent
from a register MAC address and offer the management OS to the server.

Once the management OS is booted it will request a boot configuration
from the server. The server will sent the first outstanding user
request to the server. A boot configuration indicates whether the
current state of the machine should be saved, the location of the
image that should be booted and any information about images such as
compression algorithm.

!!! Danger
	The implementation of the system message is incredibly
    simple and allows for the complete bypassing of all security
    mechanisms. Please do not deploy the BAAS project on a safety
	critical system until this mechanism is replaced with a more
	secure implementation.

Each request sent to the system is checked whether it is a system
message and hence is provided with a specific header, whether a user
is allowed to access the resource or whether the user owns that
resource.


## Control Server and Management OS interaction
```plantuml
@startuml

actor Jan
control Control
collections Machines

activate Control
Jan -> Control : Schedule an image boot

...

== Machine Handshake ==
Machines -> Control : Request iPXE image
Control -> Control : Check if the MAC address is registered
Control --> Machines : Send management boot image
activate Machines

== Boot sequence ==
Machines -> Control : Request boot configuration
Control --> Machines : Return the first outstanding configuration
Control -> Control : Register it as sent
Machines -> Control : Upload the current disk data
Control -> Control : Save to disk

Machines -> Control : Request the image data
Control --> Machines : Return the image file
Machines --> Machines : Reboot into the image
deactivate Machines
Control --> Jan : Notify the user that his image is online
